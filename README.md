# Question: How can you determine if all courses can be finished given prerequisites (cycle detection in a graph)? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to the problem of determining whether all courses can be finished given a set of prerequisites, which is essentially a problem of cycle detection in a directed graph. The code defines a CourseScheduler class that represents a directed graph where each node is a course and each edge is a prerequisite relationship. The class maintains an adjacency list to represent the graph, and two arrays to keep track of visited nodes and nodes in the recursion stack during the Depth-First Search (DFS). The DFS is implemented in the isCyclicUtil method, which checks for a cycle starting from a given node. If a cycle is detected, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. The isCyclic method applies isCyclicUtil to all nodes in the graph. The canFinish function uses the CourseScheduler class to create a graph from the input and checks if it contains a cycle. If a cycle exists, it means there are circular dependencies among the courses, hence not all courses can be finished, and the function returns false. If no cycle exists, it means all courses can be finished, and the function returns true.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution solves the problem in a similar way to the JavaScript version, using Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in a directed graph. However, there are some differences in the way the two versions are implemented due to the features and syntax of TypeScript.

1. Type Annotations: TypeScript version uses type annotations to ensure type safety. For example, the `numCourses` parameter in the `canFinish` function is annotated as `number`, and the `prerequisites` parameter is annotated as a two-dimensional number array `number[][]`. The `canFinish` function itself is annotated to return a boolean value.

2. Class Properties: In the TypeScript version, the `Course` class has properties `isVisited`, `isStack`, and `children` which are directly initialized in the class. This is a feature of TypeScript that allows class properties to be declared and initialized in one place.

3. Array of Objects: In the TypeScript version, an array of `Course` objects is created using the `Array` constructor and the `map` method. This is different from the JavaScript version where a `Map` object is used to store the adjacency list and two separate arrays are used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack.

4. Function Extraction: The TypeScript version extracts the `isCyclic` function out of the class, making it a standalone function that takes a `Course` object as a parameter. This is different from the JavaScript version where `isCyclic` is a method of the `CourseScheduler` class.

Overall, the TypeScript version provides better type safety and arguably cleaner code due to the use of class properties and the extraction of the `isCyclic` function. However, the core logic of using DFS to detect cycles in a graph remains the same in both versions.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a similar approach to the JavaScript version. Both versions use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in a directed graph. The main difference lies in the language-specific features and syntax used in each version.

In the JavaScript version, a CourseScheduler class is created to represent the directed graph of courses and their prerequisites. The class has methods to check if a cycle exists in the graph. The `canFinish` function creates a new CourseScheduler and checks if there is a cycle in the graph.

In the C++ version, there is no class. Instead, the graph is represented using an unordered_map where the key is the course and the value is a vector of courses that are prerequisites. The `isCyclic` function checks if a cycle exists in the graph.

The JavaScript version uses a Map to store the adjacency list of the graph, while the C++ version uses an unordered_map. The JavaScript version uses Array's fill method to initialize the visited and recStack arrays, while the C++ version uses vector's constructor to initialize the visited and recStack vectors.

The JavaScript version uses a for-of loop to iterate over the prerequisites, while the C++ version uses a traditional for loop. The JavaScript version uses the Array's push method to add an element to the end of an array, while the C++ version uses the vector's push_back method.

The JavaScript version uses the console.log function to print the result, while the C++ version uses the cout object. The JavaScript version returns a boolean value from the `canFinish` function, while the C++ version prints a message to the console from the main function.
